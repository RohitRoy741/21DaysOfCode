			<h3>The Art Of Coding</h3>
			<div class="img-container">
				<img src="Intro.jpg" height="500px">

			<p class="intro">Hey there, how are you? This is one of my early projects as a web designer. Although the challenge is obvious from its name, let me explain it a little bit. Coding is more of an art than science. It is the art of solving problems. Although many people think that a programming language is the most important part of the process of becoming a coder, well it's not. Not that it's completely irrelevant, but logic and thinking always takes the front seat in the art of coding. Coding is basically solving a problem with the use of resources provided by the machine and in order to use those resources we have to tell our machines how to use them. Now this how part is very important. As you can guess that before telling your machine how to solve a problem, you have to know how to solve it yourself first. DUH! This part of coding is called logic building. After building the logic to solve the problem you just have to translate that to your machine. This is where those programming languages come into play. C,C++,Java,Python,Go,C# and all the other general purpose programming languages essentially do the same thing! They translate your logic to the machine. So in this challenge we are going to master one such general purpose programming language and solve as many problems as we can. So, lets get to it!</p>

			<h3>Rules Of The Game</h3>
			<article class="box">
				<h5>Consistency</h5>
				<p>The key to get better at any sport is consistency and dedication. So why would coding be any different? The first and most important rule of this game will be maintaining consitency. We will try to code daily for at least an hour, taking on various kinds of problem each day. Apart from this we will also try to dedicate one hour to learning various concepts of progamming. Hands on practice is the key to learning code but a little theory wont hurt you.</p>

				<h5>Commitment</h5>
				<p>This isn't one of your exams and thus you are not commited to your institue. Instead you are commited to yourself. Throughout this challenge it is neccessary that you remain true to yourself and be clear about your goals. Nobody will judge you if you leave this challenge in middle and you may have geniuine reasons for that. What I want you to do is come back whenever you can and complete this challenge. And I can guarrantee you that you will come out of this as a better coder.</p>
			</article>
			<article class="box">
				<h5>Communication</h5>
				<p>It's always better to work with a team. Coding with your peers will improve not only add a little competetion spice but will also help you build your teamwork skills. So communicate with others whereever you want to. You can tweet your progress, upload your codes to github, or connect to me through this web site. All the best!</p>

		<h3 >Register yourself to the challenge!</h3>
		<div class="form-dis">
			
			<p class="form-text">Fill the adjoining form to register yourself. Enter your github handle and upload you code there at the end of each day and I will feature it on this site's page. The coder with most number of credible codes will be the winner of this contest and will feel good for atleast 20 minutes :). Try to study a different topic after two or three days. Some of the popular topics include: Data Structures, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming. My favourite coding sites include <a href="www.hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a>,<a href="www.codechef.com">CodeChef</a> and LeetCode, be sure to check them out. This challenge is mainly for practicing problem solving but its alright if you want to practice coding by completing your project or something.</p>
